#HELLO
Im going to be honest I have very little idea on any of the formatting conventions of githunb, but making branches and forks makes sense, pull requests are just telling the owner "hey i did the stuff should we make it part of the Main branch" and so on.
I dont particularly like markdown, but it is simple to write in. I have no clue what the heck the deliverables to upload to the scripting assignment zero are.
