# Hello Everyone, I'm Aaron!  

## **What I Learned about GitHub So Far...** 

I recently went through the Git & GitHub Crash Course and completed the initial setup steps for my GitHub profile and repository. Here’s a summary of what I learned:  
- How to create a new repository on GitHub.  
- How to clone the repository on My local computer
- Understand how to use `git add`, `git pull`, and `git push` in the terminal.  
- How to create and edit Markdown files.  
- Basic Git workflow: staging, committing, and pushing changes.  
 

## **What I’m Still Confused About**

Even though I’ve learned a lot, there are a few areas I want to explore further:
- How to resolve merge conflicts when multiple changes happen on the same file, but from different devices.  
  - I am unable to replicate the setup process I did on my PC, on my MacBook.
  - Editing the same file and on both devices results in a several errors.

## **Next Steps**  
I will definitely be creating some private repositories to practice more.

However, I have finished the introductory setup steps and watched the Git & GitHub Crash Course. 
I’m excited to start applying these skills in real projects and experimenting with different Markdown styles in my profile README.
