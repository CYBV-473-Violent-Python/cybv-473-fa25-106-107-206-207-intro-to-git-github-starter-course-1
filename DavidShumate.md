# What I have learned so far
-This is my first time using GitHub, and it is a little confusing.
- Thanks to GitHub Docs, I am learning the basics of the syntax here. I also figured out how to put an emoji🙏
- I am also a little confused as to where exactly I am supposed to put this file, so hopefully I am putting it in the right spot.
- I am beginning to understand the topics for the first assignment, thanks to GitHub Docs and the crash course. Pull requests, forking and cloning repositories, etc...
